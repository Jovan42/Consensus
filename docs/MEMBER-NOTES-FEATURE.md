# Member Notes Feature Documentation

This document describes the member notes feature that allows users to keep private notes for each round in their clubs.

## üåü Overview

The member notes feature provides a way for club members to keep private, personal notes about each round. These notes are completely private and only visible to the member who created them - not even club admins can see them.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Reading Notes**: Keep track of thoughts, quotes, and insights while reading a book
- **Movie Reviews**: Write personal reviews and thoughts about movies watched
- **Gaming Notes**: Record strategies, achievements, or memorable moments from games
- **General Reflection**: Any personal thoughts or observations about the round's content

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Complete Privacy**: Notes are only visible to the member who created them
- **Admin Access**: Even club administrators cannot view member notes
- **Data Isolation**: Each member's notes are completely separate from others
- **Secure Storage**: Notes are stored securely in the database with proper access controls

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The `member_notes` table stores all private notes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE member_notes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  content TEXT,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  member_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  round_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES rounds(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(member_id, round_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/member-notes/round/:roundId` - Get or create a note for a specific round
- `PUT /api/member-notes/:noteId` - Update a note
- `GET /api/member-notes` - Get all notes for the authenticated member
- `DELETE /api/member-notes/:noteId` - Delete a note
